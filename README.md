Parent-Teacher Interaction Portal

A simple web application to provide a platform for teachers to interact with parents. The interaction is made possible by giving teachers the capability to update marks and attendance of a student. While a parent can view the marks and attendance of their child. This project is built using Flask framework, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
